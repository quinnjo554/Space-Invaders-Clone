# Space-Invaders-Clone
I am new to c++ and wanted to learn more by making a terminal game
This mostly uses the standard library with a few exeptions such as sound.
The controlls are WASD to move and space bar to shoot
It uses files to track high scores and display them on the start menu
I understand this code is not the best(huge understatment) but I am learning more everyday and am having lot of fun
Thank You
